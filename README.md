# Diane Sanchez Capstone_Proposal

## Problem Statement

Too many people refuse to get medical and mental health because they cant afford it. This app proposes an initiative 
to help change that stigma starting with office ergonomics. There are a lot of simple stretches that can vastly improve the quality of life while promoting wellness. With mindFULL users will be able to select area of pain on a graph and then 2 different stretch reccomendations will be displayed that can be saved to their profile as a reference guide for the future.
